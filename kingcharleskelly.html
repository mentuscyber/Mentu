	<p style="font-family: arial black; font-size:60%; text-align:left;"> Firstly, What is a Cyber Cafe?</p>
	  <p style="font-family: arial; font-size:35%; font-weight: normal; text-align:justify;">An Internet café, also known as a cybercafé, is a café (or a convenience store or a fully dedicated Internet access business) that provides the use of computers with high bandwidth Internet access on the payment of a fee. Usage is generally charged by the minute or part of hour. An Internet cafe will generally also offer refreshments or other services such as phone repair. Internet cafes are often hosted within a shop or other establishment. They are located worldwide, and many people use them when traveling to access webmail and instant messaging services to keep in touch with family and friends. Apart from travelers, in many developing countries Internet cafés are the primary form of Internet access for citizens as a shared-access model is more affordable than personal ownership of equipment and/or software. Internet cafés are a natural evolution of the traditional café. As Internet access rose many pubs, bars and cafés added terminals eroding the distinction between the Internet café and normal cafés.</p>
	 <p style="font-family: arial; font-size:35%; font-weight: normal; text-align:justify;"> A cybercafe is a type of business where computers are provided for accessing the internet, playing games,
chatting with friends or doing other computer-related tasks. In most
cases, access to the computer and internet is charged based on time. There
are many internet cafes located worldwide, and in some countries they are
considered the primary form of internet access for people. </p>
<p style="font-family: arial; font-size:35%; font-weight: normal; text-align:justify;">One of the salient features of cybercafes is the fact that they are far less expensive than personal ownership of computer hardware or software as they make use of the shared access model. Most cybercafes have printers, scanners and other similar peripherals for customer use. They usually have high performance computers and are frequently suited for PC gamers. Another feature is that the average internet speed is faster than home internet, and this helps in reducing the timeouts or any lag due to interrupted internet connections.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial; font-size:35%; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;">There are many advantages associated with cybercafes. In countries where internet or computer access is not affordable or available, a cybercafe can provide the benefits of both computers and internet to the local population. For short durations of time, usage of an internet cafe is cheaper than renting a computer for computer-related tasks. In most countries, the internet cost at cybercafes is much cheaper than other alternatives. In many cases, cybercafes have all the necessary accessories and software for any visitor, making their experience worthwhile.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial; font-size: 35%; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;">There are certain drawbacks related to cybercafes. For one, cybercafes are never suited for work-related or sensitive information, as they have considerable security risks. Additionally, cybercafes are generally not as comfortable as one’s own home. They can be crowded and can sometimes operate on a limited schedule, thereby limiting the customers’ options. At times, downloads at cybercafes can be limited to preserve bandwidth.</p>
